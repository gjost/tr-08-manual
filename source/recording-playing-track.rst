Recording or Playing a Rhythm Track
===================================

**About composing**

You can compose (assemble) a rhythm track by successively switching between rhythm patterns during playback.

**About memory (storage)**

A track does not store the actual rhythm patterns that are played. Instead, it contains the rhythm select switch numbers (basic rhythm, intro/fill-in) that are written in the rhythm patterns, the number of measures, and the order in which they are played; this data is stored for each measure.

During track play, you’ll need to set the basic (or I/F) variation switch as it was when you composed the track.

**Moving a measure**

1. Hold down the [START/STOP] button and press a [1]–[10] button to select the move-destination.
   Press the [16] button to move the measure to the last measure.
2. Release the [START/STOP] button to confirm the operation.
   You can also select the destination by turning the [FINE] (VALUE) knob.



Composing a Rhythm Track
------------------------

**Selecting/clearing a track**

1. From the stopped condition, set the mode switch to the rhythm track “COMPOSE” position.
2. Set the select switch to the desired position.
3. Press the [CLEAR] button.

**Composing (when the compose mode is “ OrG ”)**

4. Specify measure 1, and press the [START/STOP] button.
   The rhythm starts.

5. While listening to the rhythm, switch between the BASIC RHYTHM [1]–[12] buttons (or the INTRO/FILL IN [1]–[4] buttons and [TAP] button).

6. When the last measure to be composed has played, press the [START/STOP] button before that measure ends.
   The rhythm stops. Even if the notes are interrupted, they have been stored to the end of the measure.
   The measure at which you pressed the [START/STOP] button will be the last measure.

**Editing a portion (measure) of a rhythm pattern that you composed**

1. Use the select switch to select a track, and press the [START/STOP] button.
2. The moment that the measure that you want to edit is playing, switch to the rhythm pattern.
   * To edit a fill-in rhythm, use the intro/fill-in switch to make the switch instead of using the [TAP] button.
   * It’s not possible to change only the number of measures in a composed rhythm pattern. If you want to change the number of measures, you must re-compose from the beginning.

**Copying measures (Copy)**

* Keep holding down the [TAP] button during the copy operation. The operation is cancelled if you release the [TAP] button.

1. At the beginning of the copy-destination measure, hold down the [TAP] button.
   The display indicates “ COPy. ”
   Example: If you select measure 5, the data is pasted between measure 4 and measure 5.

2. (Continuing to hold down the [TAP] button) Press the [START/STOP] button, and select the starting measure of the copy-source.
   The screen indicates the measure number.
   Use the [1]–[10] buttons or the [VALUE] knob to make the selection.
   Press the [16] button to move the measure to the last measure.
   
3. (Continuing to hold down the [TAP] button) Press the [START/STOP] button, and select the ending measure of the copy-source.
   Use the [1]–[10] buttons or the [VALUE] knob to make the selection.
   Press the [16] button to select the last measure.

4. (Continuing to hold down the [TAP] button) Press the [START/STOP] button to execute the copy operation.

**Inserting measures (Ins)**

* Keep holding down the [TAP] button during the insert operation. The operation is cancelled if you release the [TAP] button.

1. At the location where you want to insert measures, hold down the [TAP] button and turn the [FINE] (VALUE) knob to select “ InS .”
   Example: If you select measure 5, the data is inserted between measure 4 and measure 5.

2. (While continuing to hold down the [TAP] button) press the [START/STOP] button and select the insert-source measure.
   The screen indicates the measure number.
   Press one of the [1]–[10] buttons or turn the [FINE] (VALUE) knob to select the last measure that will be inserted.
   Press the [16] button to move the measure to the last measure.

**Deleting measures (Del)**

* Keep holding down the [TAP] button during the delete operation. The operation is cancelled if you release the [TAP] button.
1. At the measure that you want to delete, hold down the [TAP] button and turn the [FINE] (VALUE) knob to select “dEL .”
2. (Continuing to hold down the [TAP] button) Press the [START/STOP] button to select the ending measure.
   The screen indicates the measure number.
   Press one of the [1]–[10] buttons or turn the [FINE] (VALUE) knob to select the last measure that will be deleted.
   Press the [16] button to move the measure to the last measure.
3. (Continuing to hold down the [TAP] button) Press the [START/STOP] button to execute the delete operation.

**Composing (when the compose mode is “ SteP ”)**

1. Select the track that you want to compose, and clear it.
   => “Selecting a position and clearing it”
2. Press the [START/STOP] button.
   The rhythm starts.
3. Use the BASIC RHYTHM [1]–[12] buttons (or the INTRO/FILL IN [1]–[4] buttons) to select a rhythm pattern.
4. Press the [TAP] button to advance the measure.
5. Repeat steps 3–4.
6. When you’ve entered the last measure that you want to compose, press the [START/STOP] button.


Playing a Rhythm Track
----------------------

1. Set the mode switch to rhythm track “PLAY.”
2. Set the basic variation switch to the position of the first measure.
3. Press the [START/STOP] button.
4. When the last measure has ended, press the [START/STOP] button.
   Playback continues repeating until you stop it.

**When you switch rhythm tracks**

If you operate the select switch while a track is playing, the currently-playing rhythm pattern plays to its end, and then playback moves to the first measure of the newly selected track.
