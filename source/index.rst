Roland TR-08 Rhythm Composer Owner's Manual (English)
=====================================================

Copyright Â© 2017 ROLAND CORPORATION

.. important::
   This is an HTML transcription of the Owner's Manual PDF available from Roland.com, and its copyright status is therefore dubious.  I made it because I found the PDF and the paper manual basically unusable, and is published in the hope that it helps others to unlock obscure features of the TR-08 that might go unnoticed due to the formatting of the official documentation.
