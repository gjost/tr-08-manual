Turning the TR-08 On
--------------------

G. [POWER] switch

    This turns the power on/off.

    * After you’ve made connections correctly, be sure to turn on the power in the order of the TR-08 first, and then the connected system. Powering-on in the incorrect order may cause malfunctions or damage. When turning the power off, power-off the connected system first, and then the TR-08.

    * Before turning the unit on/off, always be sure to turn the volume down. Even with the volume turned down, you might hear some sound when switching the unit on/off. However, this is normal and does not indicate a malfunction.
